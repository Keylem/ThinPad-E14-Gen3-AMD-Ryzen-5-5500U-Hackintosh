 ### Intended to be run on Big Sur with recovery installer.
 !! If possible, use the ethernet port while installing from the recovery !!
 In the USB stick, to use recovery installer, use the EFI folder.
 After setting up the recovery, press "space" to unveil the hidden options
 Be cautious when resetting the nvram, as it is known to brick some thinkpads (mine didin't but be aware of it)
 !! After installing and setting up the system, mount your internal SSD's EFI partition and use the EFI folder provided in "EFI_TO_USE_AFTER_INSTALLATION" !!
 Please create a unique SMBIOS number using the MacBookPro16,3 scheme if you want to connect to your apple id at any point.

Status

- No graphics acceleration is available for Renoir right now (but will be at some point) so if possible please update the NootedRed.kext to it's newest from the artifacts tab --> https://github.com/NootInc/NootedRed/actions .
- Sleep should be modified to use hibernation value 3 (broken by design for now because fo the NootedRed
- CPU power Management is partially working, but needs AMD Power Gadget.app to function.
- Some adobe apps and docker containers straight up does not work
- 3.5mm Jack (bcs I don't have wired headphones so I can not test it)
- No mic is detected and the reason is unknown
- Startup dong is enabled by default
- Starts up with a pretty theme with the EFI intended to be used after installation.

What is working?

- Graphics detected
- Wifi works (must be replaced with an intel ax200/ax210 card)
- Bluetooth
